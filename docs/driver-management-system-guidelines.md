# Driver Management System Guidelines

This document outlines the guidelines and recommendations for improving the driver management system's page architecture, component division, and UI layout.

## 1. Page Architecture

- Implement state management (e.g., Pinia) for complex state handling across components.
- Add a driver details page for comprehensive individual driver views.
- Implement error boundaries for graceful error handling and display.

## 2. Component Division

### Existing Components

- **DriverFilter**: 
  - Break down into smaller components (WarehouseFilter, TeamFilter, etc.) if it becomes more complex.
  - Implement more advanced search functionality.
  - Utilize the NimshipFilter component for flexible filter rendering:
    - Use ButtonSwitcher for filters with 3 or fewer options.
    - Use Select for filters with more than 3 options.
    - Allow manual override of display mode using the 'as' prop (Button, Select, or auto).
  - Implement horizontal scrolling for filters when space is limited.

- **NimshipFilter**:
  - Integrate ButtonSwitcher component for improved user experience with fewer options.
  - Implement dynamic rendering based on the number of options and 'as' prop.
  - Handle both ButtonSwitcher and Select rendering within the same component.

- **ButtonSwitcher**:
  - Use for toggle-style selection of filter options when there are 3 or fewer choices.
  - Ensure consistent styling with other UI components.
  - Implement proper accessibility features for keyboard navigation and screen readers.

- **DriverTable**:
  - Create separate components for different cell types (StatusCell, RatingCell, etc.).
  - Implement a separate DriverActionMenu component for the dropdown in each row.

- **DriverDialog**:
  - Split into smaller components: DriverPersonalInfo, DriverEmploymentInfo, DriverLicenseInfo.

### New Components

- **DriverStats**: To display key statistics about drivers.
- **DriverBulkActions**: For performing actions on multiple selected drivers.

## 3. UI Layout

- Implement a responsive design for mobile devices:
  - Use a collapsible sidebar for filters on smaller screens.
  - Adjust table layout for mobile viewing (e.g., stacked view for narrow screens).

- Enhance the DriverTable:
  - Add column resizing and hiding capabilities.
  - Implement sticky headers for better navigation on large datasets.
  - Add row selection for bulk actions.

- Improve the filter section:
  - Add the ability to save and load filter presets.
  - Implement an advanced search modal for more complex queries.
  - Ensure filters are scrollable horizontally when space is limited, without occupying additional vertical space.
  - Use ButtonSwitcher for a more compact and user-friendly interface for filters with few options.

- Add a dashboard section:
  - Display key metrics and charts above the filter section.

- Improve accessibility:
  - Ensure proper ARIA labels are used throughout, especially in custom components like ButtonSwitcher.
  - Implement keyboard navigation for the table and filters.

## 4. Performance Optimizations

- Implement virtualization for the DriverTable to handle large datasets efficiently.
- Use debounce for filter inputs to reduce unnecessary API calls.
  - Apply debounce to both Select and ButtonSwitcher inputs in NimshipFilter.
- Implement pagination or infinite scrolling for large datasets.

## 5. Additional Features

- Implement export functionality (CSV, PDF) for driver data.
- Add a driver import feature for bulk adding of drivers.
- Implement a change history or audit log for driver information changes.

## 6. Code Improvements

- Standardize error handling across components.
- Implement more robust type checking, especially for API responses.
- Consider using a form library like vee-validate consistently across all forms.
- Implement unit and integration tests for critical components and functions.
- Ensure proper prop validation and default values in all components, including ButtonSwitcher and NimshipFilter.

## 7. UX Enhancements

- Add tooltips for complex fields or actions.
- Implement inline editing for quick updates in the DriverTable.
- Add confirmation dialogs for critical actions (e.g., deleting a driver).
- Implement a "What's New" feature to highlight recent changes or new features.
- Ensure smooth transitions when switching between ButtonSwitcher and Select in NimshipFilter.

By implementing these recommendations, we aim to create a more maintainable, scalable, and user-friendly driver management system. The improved architecture, including the new ButtonSwitcher component and enhanced NimshipFilter, will allow for easier future enhancements and better performance with large datasets while providing a more intuitive user interface.
