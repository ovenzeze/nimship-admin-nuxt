2. Try updating both to their latest compatible versions:

   ```bash
   npm update vue nuxt
   ```

   ```

## Updating Dependencies

```

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any package-related issues:

1. Clear your npm cache:

   rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
   npm install
   ```

3. If the issue persists, check for any conflicting peer dependencies and resolve them manually.
